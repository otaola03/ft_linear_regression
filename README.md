Create a simple lineal regresion from a data set to predict the price of a car depending on it's Km

## Basic Concepts
Linear regression is a model that uses a straight line to show how one variable depends on another, including a margin of error for the unpredictable. In a easy go to understand, is like a mean representend in a linear way that gives you the more approximated output value y to its corresponding input value x.

The formula of a simple linear regresion is the next one:

$$
y = mx + b
$$
